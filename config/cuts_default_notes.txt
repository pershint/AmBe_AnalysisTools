Description of different cut configuration toggles

Depending on your ultimate end-game, your config file will want to be configured
differently.  Here is a guide for helping with this process/building your own
config file.

###----------PATHOLOGICAL CUTS FOR SACRIFICE-----------###
Events that are considered pathological are not included in the
               sacrifice studies.
fitValid: if true, only events with a valid reconstruction will be used
to estimate the sacrifice with calibration data/instrumental contamination with
analysis data.  If false, events with AND without fitValid will be considered.


isCal: if true, only events with the FECD PMT hit in the calibration data
will be used to estimate the sacrifice with calibration data. 
(You want this to be true if you're using N16 calibration data)

AVudotrCut: if true, implements the AV cut used to select events from
the AV ROI.  Specific function should be specified in waterdoc, but is:
(udotr > (1.0 - 12 *((posr3-%f)**2)))"%(posr3_AVcut)


E_high, E_low: Defines the energy range for events considered for sacrifice
analysis
nhits_high, nhits_low: Defines the nhit range for events consiered for
sacrifice analyses
Z_high,Z_low: Defines the z-range, in centimeters, for events considered for
sacrifice studies
r_high, r_low: Defines the radius, in millimeters, for events considered for
sacrifice studies
udotr_high, udotr_low: Defines the u.r value range for events considered for
the sacrifice studies

sacpath_DCmask: pathological cuts applied before estimating sacrifice using
calibration data. Any
event with one of the flags in this mask will not be used in the sacrifice/
contamination studies.

(Relevant for contamination study only. For most standalone DC sacrifice analyses,
 you'll want sacpath_DCmask to be set to zero.)


path_trigmask: Any events with a flag from this trigger mask
 will not be considered/used for the sacrifice studies
(ND contamination analysis default is esumhi, esumlo, ped, pgt)
(When doing most DC sacrifice studies, you'll want this to be set to zero)
